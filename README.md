# TRACE
TRACE (Texture Rendering with Annotated Color Encoding) is an interactive Web3D tool based on ATON framework for visualizing and inspecting 3D models, designed to highlight and compare modified or reconstructed areas through false-color texturing, developed under CHANGES project.
                    
The system supports *transparency and traceability* of manual interventions carried out by 3D modelers, such as integrations used to fill *holes* that emerged due to complex acquisition conditions.TRACE supports models with color-coded maps, multiple textures, and interactive inspection using a slider.
